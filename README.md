# Nub

Nub is little CLI app that helps you work on Rust, Go and TypeScript projects.

## Features

The goal is to:

- 🛠️ Set up projects with their modern tooling (linters, formatters, etc)
- ✈️ Deploy them in one command to @Cloudflare, @vercel, @flydotio etc
- 📚 Switch context between programming languages through documentation lookup
- 💾 Reuse common utilities and helpers using snippets
- 🔍 Spot mistakes and improvements using AI
- 🤖 Bootstrap AI projects with ready to deploy templates

Nub is very young but is already able to set up Rust, Go and TypeScript projects!
